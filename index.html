                <p>My name is Tim, and I'm a Junior Software Developer that also enjoys playing guitar, video games and watching Formula 1!</p>
                <p>I initially learned a small amount of C++ whilst at University, and enjoyed that. I then became interested in web devlopment and the different things you could do with it, and began teaching myself HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, before enrolling in the Command Shift Bootcamp.</p>
